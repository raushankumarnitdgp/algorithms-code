/*
*given a C++ Program that finds the inverse of a 3*3 matrix 
*using the Adjoint method given as follows A^(-1)=1/det⁡A 〖(cofactor of A)〗^T 
*Further details of this method you can find on the web page 
*http://www.mathwords.com/i/inverse_of_a_matrix.htm. 
*Matrix is represented by a two dimensional array in the program. 
*And the matrix should be initialized by the random values each 
*time you run the program
